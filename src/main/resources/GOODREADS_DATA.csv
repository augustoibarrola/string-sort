Helen – 18 years old, bored, horny, and hospitalized – spends the 200 plus pages musing about everything from her graphic (keyword here, folks – be warned) sexual experiences to her family's grim and undiscussed history to avocado trees. She's an experience. I felt as trapped in her head as she must have felt in her hospital room, in her life. It felt something like solidarity, after a while, to grimace while reading. She is in pain of all kinds, and being disgusted gave my face contours that mimed Helen's pain, even if mine came from being nauseous and not abandoned. <br/>I finished this book on the toilet, which is probably one of the more appropriate places to finish this particular novel off. I think Helen would have been proud.",,,1,0

Maybe it could even read a little hoaky if weren't so genuinely terrifying and heartbreaking. Somewhere between a story of brutal intrafamily politics and their vie for power and one of a dark god and its deranged followers, Enriquez brings us into a world beyond locked doors, where there is no moon or stars and it is always night, and the hot breath of hunger soaks the air. Must-read for a quick sinister glimpse into the dark esoteric world around us.",,,1,1

Samantha Matthews (a pseudonym for an American actress living in Barcelona) leads us through her personal musings, reflecting on her early childhood abuse and its subsequent ripples throughout her life. This is not a standard 'survivor' narrative; nowhere in Samantha's vocabulary can the words 'survivor,' or 'trigger,'  be found. She refuses to pigeonhole herself as someone defined by their abusers. 'That Thing You Do With Your Mouth' shows us that nothing can define us unless we so choose it to.",,,1,1
